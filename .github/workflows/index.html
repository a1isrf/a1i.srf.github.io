      <p><strong><em>"No two things have been combined better than knowledge and patience."</strong> - Prophet Muhammadï·º,</em> what a great saying by a great person. You do not get to master the thing you learned just a second ago, you need more time. That's the thing about learning, you always need time. My journey was not started when I was born, however, it was when I started feeling the urge to do something better. Something practical. Something meaningful. 
      </p>
      <p>At the age of two, according to my parents, I started using laptops. Initially, it was just watching some childish cartoons, which I have a very vague memory of. I believe this is when I started my journey of being a "computer nerd". Following that, years went by, and I started using computers and laptops on a daily basis and so much so that, me and my father were the only ones in our family of six, to know how to use one hastily. copy-pasting folders, moving files, deleting documents, even typing, was done in seconds. My hand movements made my family think I was a lunatic (I hope they didnt mean that).
      </p>
      <p>Now, I have learned Responsive Web Designing in a month. Throughout this time, I had many annoyances. Many irritating movements. Even keyboard smashing ones as well. But, I am here now, designing this very webpage myself using the skils I learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, speaking of my academics, I am currently in the first year of my A Levels. Choosing Computer Science with Physics, Mathematics, and English Language, I hope at the end of the year, I do not succumb to the pressure I'll be getting from my subjects of choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, apart from computering, I love participating in <a href="#mun-stories">Model United Nations</a>. Moreoever, and obviously, I love wasting my time in playing games as well. Apart from that, I occasionally swim, and almost regularly go to the gym as well.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, this was a very breif "about me" but you get the gist. This is all great and all, but, you may start to think, "what does this guy wants for his future?". I guess, let's find out by living it first :)</p>
